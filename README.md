- Hi, Iâ€™m prasanna
- I Developed this scraper as one of my academic project's

IMDB
---------
For IMDB movie scraper(English/Tamil) run the codes and type the year you want to scrape. It will scrape all the movies released on that year and export it to CSV file.

TripAdvisor
---------
For Trip Advisor review scraper choose the hotel/restaurant/resorts and so on. Go to that particular restaurant page and click the customer reviews button, it will navigate you to that review page. Copy the url and place it in my code (i.e, new_url) and mainly add "-or{}" on that url. Just follow the same, what is already there.

Now it's time to find insights from the data you collected!!!
